Hi,


Below I am listing out the coomands required to push and build application on IBm clooud and Openshift respectively.


OPENSHIFT

*) The created application is binded to the github repo during creation, i.e., when a commit is done openshift is able to access it.
 hence no push is required all you need is to build the code and it automatically gets deployed.

COMMANDS (oc tool)
 oc login --token=fVc1qL1z5CLgt7pu6Hqc1VmbCpi1odB3PBRKJwYqgq0 --server=https://api.ca-central-1.starter.openshift-online.com:6443
oc project payment-gateway
 oc start-build pgw
 oc status(optional)


IBM CLOUD 

*) Gitlab is the repo. Once commit is done, the repo needs to be cloned and then pushed to cloud.

COMMANDS (cf cli tool)
git clone https://gitlab.com/andrewmoses/ibm_coe_payment.git
cd [local file name]
cf api https://api.eu-gb.bluemix.net
cf login
cf push

P.S: 
git@gitlab.com:andrewmoses/ibm_coe_payment.git  is the ssh clone id if you prefer that way.



TRY THIS!!

git clone https://gitlab.com/andrewmoses/ibm_coe_payment
cd [local directory]
ibmcloud login    {username m1.ganesh@tcs.com    pws:Periya4th2eni}
ibmcloud target --cf

ibmcloud cf push
